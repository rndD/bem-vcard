Simple BEM project which can be build with BEM MAKE tool
================================================

### Usage

    › git clone git@github.com:rndD/bem-vcard.git
    › cd bem-vcard
    › make

This will install localy all project's dependencies from npm and starts local
`bem server`
under HTTP port `8080`. So you could navigate to
`http://localhost:8080/`.

Alternative to use `make`, you could install all dependencies by your self. To
do so type `npm install` from the top
of your working copy. After that your could start server:

    › bem server

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/pages/mishanga/mishanga.html`

**NOTE:** `bem` should be in your `PATH` environment variable. You could do
this by adding this line to your user's
`.profile` config:

    export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
